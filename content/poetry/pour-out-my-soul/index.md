**I pour out my soul** to you, Lord,  
who gives me life anew.  
Loving you is its own reward,  
it sweetens all I do.

Take my sin and clear it,  
freeing me by your might.  
Fill me with the Spirit,  
God of Love, man of light.

I pour out my soul to you, Lord,  
who gives me life anew.  
Loving you is its own reward,  
it sweetens all I do.

Upon my head, your mark,  
your holy light is mine.  
I won't succumb to dark,  
in me, your light will shine.

I pour out my soul to you, Lord,  
who gives me life anew.  
Loving you is its own reward,  
it sweetens all I do.

By holy Word I fight,  
so more may be reborn.  
I am a child of light,  
who sings now of the dawn.

I pour out my soul to you, Lord,  
who gives me life anew.  
Loving you is its own reward,  
it sweetens all I do.
