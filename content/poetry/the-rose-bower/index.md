We have a rose bower  
where the flowers always bloom,  
The sweet scent calls me home.

There, we bask in majesty,  
His head is crowned in light.  
The silence of friends between us,  
or a gentle whisper under birdsong.

We sit and enjoy the company,  
He laughs as soft as new snow,  
as we reminisce over missed  
callings.

Once love drunk, now we quietly sit  
under rose perfume, looking fondly  
into the endless depths of sweet,  
sunlit eyes.

We have a rose bower  
where the flowers always bloom.  
The sweet scent calls me home.
