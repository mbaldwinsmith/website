**You were made** to be full of joy *&* peace *&* to dwell in the eternal, boundless love of the One who knows *&* adores you.

After two rejected callings, I finally let Jesus into my life just over a year ago. I'd been pursuing Buddhist enlightenment for 15 years *&* had something of an awakening experience. I was prompted to raise my hands, eyes, *&* voice in thanks to God after which I experienced a succession of insights. These are some of the comforts that Jesus wanted me to know about Him. I believe, He wants me to share these comforts with you.

After my time on the 'mountain top' of spiritual ecstasy, I was firmly nudged to step back into the world, work a normal job, *&* take time to struggle alongside people. The contrast made the experience all the more painful *&* I slipped in *&* out of spiritual slumber. I fell away from God, feeling like I was drowning under the cares of the world. Under pressure to conform to this world, I lost faith in what I'd seen. I encountered the earthly Church, who I grew to love despite her shortcomings *&* who provided me with a place of rest *&* renewal.

As I studied the sacred texts of humanity, I found that the Bible has, revealed within it, the same truths that I experienced in March 2019. From tender shoots, in rich earth watered by my soul-stricken tears, my faith grew again. This time, it grew slowly like an oak, gently nourished by the light of Jesus *&* the waters of life.

I've spent a year or so exploring these intuited truths, which shone into my heart. I've tested them against scripture, *&* tested church teaching against them, learning to put insight into words. Here's what I can grasp so far.

The cosmos was spoken into being by the eternal Logos, the Word of God, known to us in the person of Jesus Christ.

The cosmos is animated *&* sustained by the Holy Spirit, the intangible presence of God.

God is an English word for a being beyond description. The living God is, by nature, beyond the grasp of the human intellect *&* language, but can be known intuitively through a direct relationship.

The Logos *&* the Holy Spirit shine forth, like light from the Sun, from the Source of all being revealed to us as the Father. Neither the Logos nor the Spirit was created. They exist before the creation of time, space, *&* the temporal logic of cause *&* effect. They are of the same essence as the Father, *&*, together, they form the One; the living God.

We are made in the spiritual image of the living God *&* echo the threefold nature of the Son, the Father *&* the Holy Spirit in that we have body, psyche, *&* spirit.

The living God is not the only immaterial agency. There exist hosts of other spiritual beings, some of which have been falsely worshipped as gods.

This world isn't the way it was meant to be. There is a rebellion fracturing creation, built on pride, shame, *&* distrust.

Evil is an absence of good just as darkness is an absence of light. They are not equal, opposite forces.

The light shines in the darkness *&* the darkness did not overcome it.

This physical world *&* our bodies are not inherently evil or shameful. In Jesus' eyes, you are holy *&* redeemed.

The forces of evil suffered a critical defeat when they crucified Jesus Christ, exposing the powers of this world for what they are.

On a physical level, Jesus' life *&* death became a pivotal moment in human history, a symbol of hope *&* radical love overcoming fear, corrupt religion, *&* heartless cruelty.

On a spiritual level, Jesus is staging a full-scale invasion of this world to reclaim *&* renew His creation. Jesus calls people from all races, genders, *&* social groups to serve His movement. If they let Him, Jesus lavishes His friends with spiritual gifts.

Children are among Jesus' closest friends. Nothing offends Jesus more than people corrupting children, especially under the banner of His holy name.

Jesus' good news is alive *&* self-renewing, defying all efforts to control, distort, *&* extinguish it.

When you suffer, Jesus suffers with you.

As a member of the universal *&* eternal church, you are to be the bride of Christ, holy *&* blameless in His eyes.

Joined to Christ as one flesh in salvation, you are a part of the body of Christ, sharing in His inheritance as a child of God. Jesus is the head of that body.

You are a child of God *&* a child of light, adopted into the heavenly family. This is a gift.

The Source of all being loves you personally, has chosen you *&* knows everything about you. You can never be worthy of such love by your own will, but you've already been chosen *&* bought by Jesus.

You are a living temple of the Holy Spirit. Solomon's Temple was a foreshadowing of you. The outer court of the temple is your body, the inner court is your psyche, the Holy of Holies is your spirit where the presence of the living God dwells. Just as the Tabernacle was superseded by the Temple of Solomon, you are one member of the new, living Temple. Your prayers are incense to the living, indwelling presence of God.

The Holy of Holies was once forbidden, except to priests with a blood sacrifice, separated from the rest of the temple by a veil. Jesus, our eternal sacrifice *&* High Priest in one, tore the veil *&* opened the way to spiritual communion for all.

The Holy Spirit dwells within you, a constant companion *&* counselor who convicts you of your wrongdoings *&* secures your inheritance as a child of God.

The love of the living God is a refining fire that takes the joys, drudgery, *&* tragedies of this life *&* uses them to purify you into the finest gold. Like a patient gardener, the One prunes the deadwood so that you might bear more fruit.

The Holy Spirit is growing, within you, the fruits of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, *&* self-control.

Shame is not part of the plan of the living God, who is love *&* in whom there is no darkness at all. The Holy Spirit brings conviction *&* healing, not condemnation.

The spiritual forces of darkness are vanquished by Jesus, the light who shines in the darkness who will never be overcome *&* who reigns forever, enthroned upon the praises of the saints. The only power that evil holds over us now is that which our pride, shame, *&* distrust allow it.

You were made to be full of joy *&* peace *&* to dwell in the eternal, boundless love of the One who knows *&* adores you.
